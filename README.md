# MouseDriverUI

## General info
This project is a simple mouse driver user interface. This is just a UI, it doesn't change anything to your current mouse settings. The UI offers some adjustments and stores the values in an XML file. Those values are retrieved when the UI is opened again and will display in the UI.

### Important note
In order to store the mouse values properly, you will need to update the rootPath variable in the XmlData class.
